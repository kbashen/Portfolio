### Interpretation

This map visualizes Flickr photo locations across Boulder, CO, based on geotagged social media data. Each blue point represents a photo uploaded to Flickr, offering insight into where people most frequently take and share images.

The highest density of points appears along western Boulder, near the foothills and open space preserves, including trail heads, parks, and mountain access areas. This suggests that outdoor recreation and scenic landscapes are the primary drivers of social media activity in this dataset.

In contrast, central and eastern Boulder show fewer photo points, reflecting more residential, industrial, or less scenic environments where fewer photos are publicly shared.

Overall, this spatial pattern highlights that Flickr users in Boulder tend to capture and share images in natural and recreational settings, aligning with the region’s strong outdoor culture and the popularity of the Rocky Mountain front range for hiking and sightseeing.
